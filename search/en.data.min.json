[{"id":0,"href":"/usage/getting-started/","title":"Getting Started","parent":"Usage","content":"   Installation Architectural Fundamentals Accessing Database Whats next?      Installation     Before you can use PostgreSQL you need to install it, of course. It is possible that PostgreSQL is already installed at your site, either because it was included in your operating system distribution or because the system administrator already installed it. If that is the case, you should obtain information from the operating system documentation or your system administrator about how to access PostgreSQL.\nIf you are not sure whether PostgreSQL is already available or whether you can use it for your experimentation then you can install it yourself. Doing so is not hard and it can be a good exercise. PostgreSQL can be installed by any unprivileged user; no superuser (root) access is required.\nIf you are installing PostgreSQL yourself, then refer to Chapter 17 for instructions on installation, and return to this guide when the installation is complete. Be sure to follow closely the section about setting up the appropriate environment variables.\nIf your site administrator has not set things up in the default way, you might have some more work to do. For example, if the database server machine is a remote machine, you will need to set the PGHOST environment variable to the name of the database server machine. The environment variable PGPORT might also have to be set. The bottom line is this: if you try to start an application program and it complains that it cannot connect to the database, you should consult your site administrator or, if that is you, the documentation to make sure that your environment is properly set up. If you did not understand the preceding paragraph then read the next section.\nArchitectural Fundamentals     Before we proceed, you should understand the basic PostgreSQL system architecture. Understanding how the parts of PostgreSQL interact will make this chapter somewhat clearer.\nIn database jargon, PostgreSQL uses a client/server model. A PostgreSQL session consists of the following cooperating processes (programs):\n A server process, which manages the database files, accepts connections to the database from client applications, and performs database actions on behalf of the clients. The database server program is called postgres. The user\u0026rsquo;s client (frontend) application that wants to perform database operations. Client applications can be very diverse in nature: a client could be a text-oriented tool, a graphical application, a web server that accesses the database to display web pages, or a specialized database maintenance tool. Some client applications are supplied with the PostgreSQL distribution; most are developed by users.  As is typical of client/server applications, the client and the server can be on different hosts. In that case they communicate over a TCP/IP network connection. You should keep this in mind, because the files that can be accessed on a client machine might not be accessible (or might only be accessible using a different file name) on the database server machine.\nThe PostgreSQL server can handle multiple concurrent connections from clients. To achieve this it starts (“forks”) a new process for each connection. From that point on, the client and the new server process communicate without intervention by the original postgres process. Thus, the supervisor server process is always running, waiting for client connections, whereas client and associated server processes come and go. (All of this is of course invisible to the user. We only mention it here for completeness.)\nAccessing Database     Once you have created a database, you can access it by:\n Running the PostgreSQL interactive terminal program, called psql, which allows you to interactively enter, edit, and execute SQL commands. Using an existing graphical frontend tool like pgAdmin or an office suite with ODBC or JDBC support to create and manipulate a database. These possibilities are not covered in this tutorial. Writing a custom application, using one of the several available language bindings. These possibilities are discussed further in Part IV.  You probably want to start up psql to try the examples in this tutorial. It can be activated for the postgres database by typing the command:\n$ psql postgres If you do not supply the database name then it will default to your user account name.\nIn psql, you will be greeted with the following message:\npsql (12.1) Type \u0026#34;help\u0026#34; for help. postgres=\u0026gt; The last line could also be:\npostgres=# That would mean you are a database superuser, which is most likely the case if you installed the PostgreSQL instance yourself. Being a superuser means that you are not subject to access controls. For the purposes of this tutorial that is not important.\nIf you encounter problems starting psql then go back to the previous section. The diagnostics of createdb and psql are similar, and if the former worked the latter should work as well.\nThe last line printed out by psql is the prompt, and it indicates that psql is listening to you and that you can type SQL queries into a work space maintained by psql. Try out these commands:\npostgres=\u0026gt; SELECT version(); version ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ PostgreSQL 12.1 on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (Debian 4.9.2-10) 4.9.2, 64-bit (1 row) postgres=\u0026gt; SELECT current_date; date ------------ 2016-01-07 (1 row) postgres=\u0026gt; SELECT 2 + 2; ?column? ---------- 4 (1 row) The psql program has a number of internal commands that are not SQL commands. They begin with the backslash character, “\\”. For example, you can get help on the syntax of various PostgreSQL SQL commands by typing:\npostgres=\u0026gt; \\h To get out of psql, type:\npostgres=\u0026gt; \\q and psql will quit and return you to your command shell. (For more internal commands, type \\? at the psql prompt.) The full capabilities of psql are documented in psql. In this tutorial we will not use these features explicitly, but you can use them yourself when it is helpful.\nWhats next?     There are a lot more things to discover.

Refer to Section 24.1.6 for more information. Note that many of these settings can be overridden on a per-table basis; see Storage Parameters.\n  autoanalyze (boolean)\nControls whether the server should run the autoanalyze launcher daemon. This is on by default; however, track_counts must also be enabled for autoanalyze to work. This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line; however, autoanalyzing can be disabled for individual tables by changing table storage parameters.\n  log_autoanalyze_min_duration (integer)\nCauses each action executed by autoanalyze to be logged if it ran for at least the specified amount of time. Setting this to zero logs all autoanalyze actions. -1 (the default) disables logging autoanalyze actions. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as milliseconds. For example, if you set this to 250ms then all automatic analyzes that run 250ms or longer will be logged. In addition, when this parameter is set to any value other than -1, a message will be logged if an autoanalyze action is skipped due to a conflicting lock or a concurrently dropped relation. Enabling this parameter can be helpful in tracking autoanalyze activity. This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line; but the setting can be overridden for individual tables by changing table storage parameters.\n  autoanalyze_max_workers (integer)\nSpecifies the maximum number of autoanalyze processes (other than the autoanalyze launcher) that may be running at any one time. The default is three. This parameter can only be set at server start.\n  autoanalyze_naptime (integer)\nSpecifies the minimum delay between autoanalyze runs on any given database. In each round the daemon examines the database and issues ANALYZE commands as needed for tables in that database. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as seconds. The default is one minute (1min). This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line.\n  autoanalyze_base_threshold (integer)\nSpecifies the minimum number of inserted, updated or deleted tuples needed to trigger an ANALYZE in any one table. The default is 50 tuples. This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line; but the setting can be overridden for individual tables by changing table storage parameters.\n  autoanalyze_scale_factor (floating point)\nSpecifies a fraction of the table size to add to autovacuum_analyze_threshold when deciding whether to trigger an ANALYZE. The default is 0.1 (10% of table size). This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line; but the setting can be overridden for individual tables by changing table storage parameters.\n  Run-time Statistics     These parameters control server-wide statistics collection features. When statistics collection is enabled, the data that is produced can be accessed via the pg_stat and pg_statio family of system views. Refer to Chapter 27 for more information.\n  track_wait_events (boolean)\nEnables the collection of information on the wait events occured in each session, include occured times and timing information. This parameter is on by default. Note that even when enabled, this information is not visible to all users, only to superusers and the user owning the session being reported on, so it should not represent a security risk. Only superusers can change this setting.\n "},{"id":5,"href":"/features/undo/","title":"Undo","parent":"Features","content":"Redrock Postgres maintains records of the actions of transactions, collectively known as undo data. Redrock Postgres uses undo to do the following:\n Roll back an active transaction Recover a terminated transaction Provide read consistency  Redrock Postgres stores undo data inside the database rather than in external logs. Undo data is stored in blocks that are updated just like data blocks, with changes to these blocks generating redo. In this way, Redrock Postgres can efficiently access undo data without needing to read external logs.\nUndo data is stored in an independent tablespace. Redrock Postgres provides a fully automated mechanism, known as automatic undo management mode, for managing undos and space.\nUndos and Transactions     When a transaction starts, the database binds (assigns) the transaction to an undo segment, and therefore to a transaction table.\nMultiple active transactions can write concurrently to the same undo or to different undos. For example, transactions T1 and T2 can both write to undo U1, or T1 can write to U1 while T2 writes to undo U2.\nTransaction Rollback     When a ROLLBACK statement is issued, the database uses undo records to roll back changes made to the database by the uncommitted transaction. During recovery, the database rolls back any uncommitted changes applied from the online redo log to the data files. Undo records provide read consistency by maintaining the before image of the data for users accessing data at the same time that another user is changing it.\n"},{"id":6,"href":"/posts/","title":"News","parent":"Welcome to Redrock Documentation","content":""},{"id":7,"href":"/tags/Documentation/","title":"Documentation","parent":"Tags","content":""},{"id":8,"href":"/tags/Features/","title":"Features","parent":"Tags","content":""},{"id":9,"href":"/advanced/plscheme/","title":"PL/scheme, Procedural Language Handler","parent":"Advanced","content":"PL/scheme is a PostgreSQL procedural language handler for Scheme programming language.
